      <h4>Melinda + Craig</h4>
      <p>The couple first met at a mutual friend's party in October 2011, where Melinda willingly exchanged details with Craig, but only after discovering his current flat mate was an IT recruiter, as she was looking for a change.</p>
      <p>Craig promptly started chatting via facebook and email with her, and a month down the line Melinda finally cottoned on that Craig liked her.</p>
      <p>Their first date was making firework cupcakes in Melinda's kitchen for a Guy Fawkes night party. From that day onwards they were virtually inseparable.</p>
      <p>In January 2012 they embarked on their first of many ski trips together as part of the ski group her sister organises each year. They had such a wonderful time and made it through the whole week in total serenity, which gave Melinda complete confidence that they were ready to live with each other. Just a few months later, in June 2012, they moved in together.</p>
      <p>A year and a half later in December 2013, to Melinda's great surprise, Craig got down on one knee and proposed to his beloved Melinda. Naturally she said yes.</p>
